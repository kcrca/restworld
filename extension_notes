I can create a server-side (at least) mod to help me add some featuers I can't
without one. Here's a list of what those features might be. I don't know how
many of these are actually possible.

Part of the reason for this is to make a effort/benefit analysis.

* Showing default player skins (alex, efe, ...). It maybe possible to create a 
double-height block type uses those textures. This might be defeated by where
those textures live -- I've tried this without a mod and the system is "smart"
enough to not allow block textures to fetch from the entity area. NOTE: This
is the big one, these are texturable but entirely unshowable.

* Creaking being active in NoAI so that the eyes glow

* Creaking heart being activated for the full clock cycle

* Ghast about to fire

* Fishing, watching the hook bob and the line ... be a line

* showing particles of blocks continuously (obviously switched on and off)

There are an infinite number of things this might be able to do (such as
show a dragon fiereball in motion) which fell below any value threshold, though
if the mod was written anyway might be worth it because why not? I'm listing them
here just to remember them as they pop up.

* Get the ally to dance to music when not in AI mode (LP)

* Dragon fireball, ghast fireball, ... in motion

* Strider shivering
