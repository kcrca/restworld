* Don't make any changes to the world itself, just to the scripts, until you are sure
there are no bugs that would hurt it. Then, if there is a problem, you can just use the
original 1.18.2 to start from without harm.

Fix the color area -- cloning makes changing it very fragile. Should be able to just change
what's there, but not sure how to do it now.

center:
    * add some new 1.19 things

friendlies:
    * goats have separate left/right horns, rotate through the states
    * parrots: (from 1.18 or earlier)
	dance to music (flying or sitting, so on/off switch?) [can't: playing music requires the act of putting it in, can't do it via commands.]
    * frogs can shoot tongue long distance [fixed by adding frog vs. slime to arena]
    * Dealing with the new mobs

monsters:
    * move end mobs into room with dragon, expanding probably
    * move nether mob room plus wither so it is directly across from entrance (no rotating it, just move)
	no real need to separate wither, just have a visible border to cross that summons it; allows us to put nether room door right across from monster door
    * create room for Warden

materials:
    * Gotta figure out how mangroves grow (no sapling) only in new mangrove forest thing?
    * And how to display propagule pots?
    * boat with chest

gui:
    * Elytra needs to show damaged texture (only shows in inventory, so probably it's an item not in the creative inv

fonts:
    * add mangrove sign
    * put signs on either side of target pointing at it

particles:
    * sculk soul and [sculk] shrieker

effects:
    * add darkness

blocks:
    * sculk stuff
    * Reinforced Deepslate
    * Forglights
    * Mangrove tree parts
    * Mud

death:
    n lower to new bottom?

plants:
    * soils for dripleaf, bamboo, sugar cane, dead bush, and cactus
    * mangrove propagule in pot

biomes:
    * new biome for mangrove has different colors of water, etc.? or same as swamp? [need to wait until 3p editors support 1.19, can't find a way to set the biome]
    * mangrove swamp
    _ ancient city

paintings:
    * new paintings, four in a series, I guess we grow the room a little, could show them in a 2x2 matrix.

arena:
    * place hunter/victim in random locations clustered around home instead of at home. Possibly create some armor stands
      sharing a tag, and tell the spawn commend to pick a random entity with that tag?
    * add more battlers

photo:
    _ Total rework: Nothing from 1.7 (moss, etc.) onward!
