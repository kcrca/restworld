Don't make any changes to the world itself, just to the scripts, until you are sure
there are no bugs that would hurt it. Then, if there is a problem, you can just use the
original 1.18.2 to start from without harm.

Fix the color area -- cloning makes changing it very fragile. Should be able to just change
what's there, but not sure how to do it now.

friendlies:
    Rotate, move donkey/mule to be in line with horses
    move goat to Mule
    move bat to Donkey
    move bees to Polar Bear
    move parrot to Pand
    put firefly next to parrot? where?
    place frogs at Bees; include spawn pond
    shift llama stuff to right (or left)
    put polar bear and panda next to llamas
    parrots: (from 1.18 or earlier)
	dance to music
	sit on player's shoulder
	swims in water
    allay?

monsters:
    move end mobs into room with drgon, expanding probably
    move nether mob room plus wither so it is directly across from entrance (no rotating it, just move)
    create room for Warden to the right.

materials:
    Gotta figure out how mangroves grow (no sapling) and how to display propagule
	pots?
	only in new mangrove forest thing?

fonts:
    add mangrove sign
    put signs on either side of target pointing at it?

particles:
    somehow these feel the least stable, wait for them

effects:
    add darkness

blocks:
    sculk stuff, including sculk vein (different)
    (Is sculk + sculk vein a plant?)

death:
    lower to new bottom?
