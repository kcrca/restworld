Don't make any changes to the world itself, just to the scripts, until you are sure
there are no bugs that would hurt it. Then, if there is a problem, you can just use the
original 1.18.2 to start from without harm.

Fix the color area -- cloning makes changing it very fragile. Should be able to just change
what's there, but not sure how to do it now.

center:
    add some new 1.19 things

friendlies:
    Rotate, move donkey/mule to be in line with horses
    move goat to Mule
    move bees to Polar Bear
    move bat to Donkey
    create allay is a flier, add to flier? That screws up the above plan...
    move parrot to Panda
    put firefly next to parrot? where?
    place frogs at Bees; include spawn pond
    shift llama stuff to right (or left)
    put polar bear and panda next to llamas

    Could move axolotl to the "amphib" area (move villagers left?)
	axolotl has swimming motion that needs water

    parrots: (from 1.18 or earlier)
	dance to music (flying or sitting, so on/off switch?)
	sit on player's shoulder (no way to do this I'm pretty sure)
	swims in water (just flying, ignore)
    frogs can shoot tongue long distance

    Or...
    Move horses to right end, move donkey/mule next to them
    Move golems to right of horse-likes, in corner (prob swap order)
    Move goat to Mule
    Move llamas to Donkey, Polar Bear, Panda
    Move villagers one slot left
    Fliers:
	Move bat, parrot, allay and fireflay to Bees, etc.
	add firefly (should be small, should fit)
    Amphibs
	Move axolotl (twice, once underwater), turtle & eggs, to LLamas
	... maybe also move golems here, loosen up the Bat/Parrot area

monsters:
    move end mobs into room with drgon, expanding probably
    move nether mob room plus wither so it is directly across from entrance (no rotating it, just move)
	no real need to separate wither, just have a visible border to cross that summons it; allows us to put nether room door right across from monster door
    create room for Warden to the right.

materials:
    Gotta figure out how mangroves grow (no sapling) and how to display propagule
	pots?
	only in new mangrove forest thing?

fonts:
    add mangrove sign
    put signs on either side of target pointing at it?

particles:
    somehow these feel the least stable, wait for them

effects:
    add darkness

blocks:
    sculk stuff, including sculk vein (different)
    (Is sculk + sculk vein a plant?)

death:
    lower to new bottom?
