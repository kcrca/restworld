* Don't make any changes to the world itself, just to the scripts, until you are sure
there are no bugs that would hurt it. Then, if there is a problem, you can just use the
original 1.18.2 to start from without harm.

Fix the color area -- cloning makes changing it very fragile. Should be able to just change
what's there, but not sure how to do it now.

center:
    * add some new 1.19 things

friendlies:
    _ goats have separate left/right horns, rotate through the states

    == Dealing with the new mobs
    _ Rotate, move donkey/mule to be in line with horses
    _ move goat to Mule
    _ move bees to Polar Bear
    _ move bat to Donkey
    _ create allay is a flier, add to flier? That screws up the above plan...
    _ move parrot to Panda
    _ place frogs at Bees; include spawn pond
    _ shift llama stuff to right (or left)
    _ put polar bear and panda next to llamas

    _ Could move axolotl to the "amphib" area (move villagers left?)
	axolotl has swimming motion that needs water

    _ parrots: (from 1.18 or earlier)
	dance to music (flying or sitting, so on/off switch?)
	sit on player's shoulder (no way to do this I'm pretty sure)
	swims in water (just flying, ignore)
    _ frogs can shoot tongue long distance

    == Or...
    _ Move horses to right end, move donkey/mule next to them
    _ Move golems to right of horse-likes, in corner (prob swap order)
    _ Move goat to Mule
    _ Move llamas to Donkey, Polar Bear, Panda
    _ Move villagers one slot left
    _ Fliers:
	Move bat, parrot, allay to Bees, etc.
    _ Amphibs
	Move axolotl (twice, once underwater), turtle & eggs, to LLamas
	... maybe also move golems here, loosen up the Bat/Parrot area

monsters:
    * move end mobs into room with dragon, expanding probably
    * move nether mob room plus wither so it is directly across from entrance (no rotating it, just move)
	no real need to separate wither, just have a visible border to cross that summons it; allows us to put nether room door right across from monster door
    * create room for Warden

materials:
    * Gotta figure out how mangroves grow (no sapling) only in new mangrove forest thing?
    * And how to display propagule pots?

gui:
    * Elytra needs to show damaged texture (only shows in inventory, so probably it's an item not in the creative inv

fonts:
    * add mangrove sign
    * put signs on either side of target pointing at it

particles:
    _ somehow these feel the least stable, wait for them

effects:
    * add darkness

blocks:
    * sculk stuff
    _ including sculk vein (different) (Is sculk + sculk vein a plant?)
    * Reinforced Deepslate
    * Forglights
    * Mangrove tree parts
    * Mud

death:
    _ lower to new bottom?

plants:
    _ loop soils for: dripleaf
    _ dead bush can be on mud; create a seaprate loop for it and cane

biomes:
    _ new biome for mangrove has different colors of water, etc.? or same as swamp?
    _ mangrove swamp
    _ ancient city

paintings:
    _ new paintings, four in a series, I guess we grow the room a little, could show them in a 2x2 matrix.
    _ If the room was one or two blocks larger in both left and right, would make more room for the paintings in the middle.

arena:
    _ place hunter/victim in random locations clustered around home instead of at home. Possibly create some armor stands
      sharing a tag, and tell the spawn commend to pick a random entity with that tag?
