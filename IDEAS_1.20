_ ancient city biome

_ Mob rework:
    _ Rework into one major room, like plants and blocks.
	_ could spread to the sides at the middle to take advantage of side room
	_ or put nethers into room to the side (towards paintings)
	_ can move time area to other places
    _ Aquatics in area like with plants, integrated into the room
    _ At end, room for ender dragon (pride of place) and end stuff (put end creates flanking it?)
	_ Note that only the shulker is an end-specific mob, the others appear in the overworld
    _ Put side rooms for mini-mobs wither and warden, maybe attaching at the sides
    _ roughly(?) organize by friendly, enitral, hostile
