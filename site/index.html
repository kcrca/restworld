        <p>
            As Minecraft has evolved, there are more and more blocks and mobs! There used to be a
            few downloadable test worlds for looking at a pack, but over time these have become much
            more unwieldy, and so fewer and fewer folks have attempted to make these test worlds,
            and those that exist are either very compressed or very spread out to accommodate all
            those blocks.

        <p>
            RestWorld squares this circle by looping. In a single spot, it loops through blocks and
            mobs that are similar. So they take up a small space, and within that space, the
            variations are looped. For example, all the ores take up one block, which changes from
            coal ore to iron ore to gold ore and so on. Each is shown for a couple seconds (you can
            adjust the timing). And you can stop the looping at any time to focus on a specific ore
            texture.

        <p>
            This means all blocks and mobs are within a space you can easily maneuver. You can also
            compare how related blocks look. For example, if you want ores to look the same, you
            will notice errors much more easily when you can see a proper ore texture switch to the
            offending one.

        <p>
            A few examples may help:

            <h1>How to Use RestWorld</h1>
        </div>

        <p>
            You start out in the middle, where you can get a control book that allows you to stop
            and start the looping, as well as speeding it up or slowing it down. You can do these
            with buttons in the middle, but the book is a control you can carry with you. The book
            also has links to the other places in RestWorld (see below).

        <p> Rooms branch off in four directions. When you enter a room, its stuff starts looping
            (unless you've stopped the clock).

        <p> You'll find controls scattered around.
        <ul>
            <li>In the control book, you can open the book and then click on things that are green.
            <li>A button on red or green concrete stops or starts the clock, and the color switches
                too.
            <li>Buttons on other colored concrete change modes in a neighboring loop. For instance,
                with villagers one button changes to/from zombie villagers, another changes whether
                the loop through biomes (with all professions for a single biome), vs. looping
                through professions (with villagers with the same profession from each biome).
            <li>In the particles room, touch the signs to switch which particles are being shown.
            <li>The signs in the mob effects room let you see the icons and visuals for effects.
            <li>Placing a sign in the font room gets that text set in many places so you see how it
                looks in books, signs, and above mobs.
            <li>Other levers and buttons are labeled. And if not, just try them out!
        </ul>

            In addition to the main area, there are other destinations in RestWorld:

        <ul>
            <li>A biome sampler, which lets you see your pack in samples of many biomes. It has
                every major biome, and almost all the large structures.
            <li>A battle arena where you can see many of the mobs fighting, to see what they look
                like in action!
            <li>A snapshot photo area for your pack. This has two views, a sampler and a "quilt" of
                (almost) all the blocks. The quilt lets you compare your pack overall with another
                one by taking screen snapshots of the quilt with each pack, and then flipping
                between the snapshots.
        </ul>

        You can get to these using the book you get in the central area.

            RestWorld was built on a lot of commands and functions. In case you're interested, here
            are some details.

        <ul>
            <li> Version numbering will be the same as the Minecraft version they are built for (for
                example, version 1.16.1 is ready for Minecraft 1.16.1).
            <li> Each room only loops while you're in it (or not too far above it), to keep overhead
                down.
            <li> RestWorld is built on a lot of functions driven from command blocks, using armor
                stands to give a location that is used to base the actions. This means that it is
                somewhat easy to relocate a loop by moving where its armor stand is.
            <li> There is a big reset button outside the main area, but your best bet is to keep a
                copy of the downloaded world around to use in case of major messes.
        </ul>
