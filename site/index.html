        <p><b>Current Version: 1.19.4+x</b>
        <p>
            <i>The "+x" means that this release includes the experimental 1.20 blocks that are in the 1.19.4 release, so you can
                start working on them already!</i>
        <p>
            As Minecraft has evolved, there are more and more blocks and mobs! There used to be a few downloadable test
            worlds for looking at a pack, but over time these have become much more unwieldy, and so fewer and fewer
            folks have attempted to make these test worlds, and those that exist are either very compressed or very
            spread out to accommodate all those blocks.

        <p>
            RestWorld squares this circle by looping. In a single spot, it loops through blocks and mobs that are
            similar. So they take up a small space, and within that space, the variations are looped. For example, all
            the ores take up one block, which changes from coal ore to iron ore to gold ore and so on. Each is shown for
            a couple seconds (you can adjust the timing). And you can stop the looping at any time to focus on a
            specific ore texture.

        <p>
            This means all blocks and mobs are within a space you can easily maneuver. You can also compare how related
            blocks look. For example, if you want ores to look the same, you will notice errors much more easily when
            you can see a proper ore texture switch to the offending one.

        <p>
            A few examples may help:

        </div>

        <p>
            You start out in the middle, where you can get a control book that allows you to stop and start the looping,
            as well as speeding it up or slowing it down. You can do these with buttons in the middle, but the book is a
            control you can carry with you. The book also has links to the other places in RestWorld (see below).

        <p> Rooms branch off in four directions. When you enter a room, its stuff starts looping (unless you've stopped
            the clock).

        <p> You'll find controls scattered around.
        <ul>
            <li>You can open the control book and click on things that are green.
            <li>A button on red or green concrete stops or starts the clock, and the color switches too.
            <li>Buttons and levers on other colored concrete change modes in a neighboring loop. For instance, with
                villagers one button changes to/from zombie villagers, another changes whether the loop through biomes
                (with all professions for a single biome), vs. looping through professions (with villagers with the same
                profession from each biome).
            <li>In the particles, fonts, effects, and banners rooms, touch the signs to switch what is being shown.
                Signs also change the combatants in the Battle Arena!
            <li>Placing a sign in the font room gets that text set in many places, so you see how it looks in books,
                signs, and above mobs.
            <li>Other levers and buttons are labeled. And if not, just try them out! Every button and lever does <i>something!</i>
        </ul>

        </div>

        <p>
            In addition to the main area, there are other destinations in RestWorld:

        <ul>
            <li>A biome sampler, which lets you see your pack in samples of many biomes. It has every major biome, and
                almost all the large structures.
            <li>A battle arena where you can see many of the mobs fighting, to see what they look like in action!
            <li>A snapshot photo area for your pack. This has three views, a sampler of the blocks, a sampler of the
                mobs
                and a "quilt" of (almost) all the blocks. The quilt lets you compare your pack overall with another one
                by taking screen snapshots of the quilt with each pack, and then flipping between the snapshots.
            <li>A "DIY" room lets you set up sequences of blocks that interest you, simply by putting them down in the
                right places. If you don't see what you want, make it yourself!
            <li>
        </ul>

        You can get to these using the book you get in the central area.

        <p>
            <b><i>What, no items‽‽‽</i></b>

        <p>
            Mostly, no. If you want to see item textures, you can look in the creative inventory. There's
            nothing better I can do. Yes, there are a few items missing from the creative inventory, these can be found
            in the "GUI" room. There is a frame with each such item, a chest that contains them all, and a button that
            gives them to you.

        <p>
            The other thing about items in texture packs is how they are displayed (the <code>display</code> tag in the
            <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Model#Item_models">item model</a>). The GUI room also lets you
            see an item in the external display modes. Just put the item of interest in the frame by the armor stand and
            you can see how they look in external modes. The non-external modes &mdash;
            <code>firstperson_righthand</code>, <code>firstperson_lefthand</code>, and <code>gui</code> &mdash; are,
            well, in your hands. Or your inventory.

    <div id="Details" class="tabcontent">
        <p>
            RestWorld was built on a lot of commands and functions. In case you're interested, here are some details.

        <ul>
            <li> Version numbering will be the same as the Minecraft version they are built for (for example, version
                1.19.4+x is ready for Minecraft 1.19.4+x).
            <li> Each room only loops while you're in it (or not too far above it), to keep overhead down.
            <li> RestWorld is built on a lot of functions driven from command blocks, using armor stands to mark
                locations that are used to base the actions. This means that it is somewhat easy to relocate a loop by
                moving where its armor stand is.
            <li> There is a big reset button outside the main area, but your best bet is to keep a copy of the
                downloaded world around to use in case of major messes, or just download a new copy when you want to.
	    <li> Here are the things I know you can't see (it's a short list, and I mean it to be):
                <ul>
                    <li> There is no way to force chests to display in <a
                            href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chest#Christmas_chest">their Christmas mode</a>.
                        You'll have to change your computer's time to see that.
                    <li> The default player skins are used when accounts are created,
                        but I know of no way to show other player's skins in a world, except for the player's head, but
                        that requires well-known accounts that use these skins, and I can't find any.
                    <li> A frozen ("NoAI") Allay won't dance to music (though a frozen parrot will, go figure). You'll
                        have to summon one,
                        tie it down, and put a record in a juke box on your own if you want to see it. It probably won't
                        change your texture much, though.
                    <li> Multiplayer features, like chat and its various security and map icons, require multiple
                        players.  You'll have to recruit some friends to join your server, or get multiple accounts.
		    <li> Some plants, like kelp, have a lot of specific ages (24 for kelp), and few people will
			texture them differently, so I haven't bothered, but let me know if you care.
                    <li> Sounds. There are hundreds of them, and no obvious way to present them.
                </ul>
		As far as I know, these are the only things you can't see in the world, though some are not in the
                first place you'd look for them. If you know others, let me know, maybe I can figure out how to show
                them. (Actually I'm sure this list is incomplete in that I've forgotten to include some things I knew
                about at one point.)
		<li>Some things can only be shown in moving, active mobs, so you can't look at them as long as you like, but at least you can see them:
		<ul>
		    <li> A vex in "charging" mode can be found in the battle arena with the Evoker.
		    <li> Evoker fangs can't be shown frozen, only in motion, so that's how they appear in the Mob room,
			and also in the Battle arena with the Evoker.
		    <li> A shivering Strider can be found in the Crimson Forest in the biome sampler.
		    <li> Only a live camel will sit; one can be found in the Desert biome sample, but you'll have to wait for
			it to decide to sit, which it will in its own sweet time.
		</ul>
	</ul>
