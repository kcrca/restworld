        <p>
            As Minecraft has evolved, the number of blocks has become larger and larger. There used
            to be a few downloadable test worlds for looking at a pack, but over time these have
            become much more unwieldy. This leaves a test world builder with a choice between
            completeness, compactness, and being able to see things with enough space around them to
            see them clearly.

        <p>
            RestWorld squares this circle by looping. Blocks and mobs that are similar take up a
            small space, and within that space, the variations are looped. For example, all the ores
            take up one block, which changes from coal ore to iron ore to gold ore and so on. Each
            is shown for a couple seconds (you can adjust the timing). And you can stop the looping
            at any time to focus on a specific ore texture.

            This means you have all blocks and mobs within a space that you can traverse. You can
            also compare how related blocks look. For example, if you want ores to look the same,
            you will notice errors much more easily when you can see the offending ore switched to
            from another one.

        <p>
            A few examples may help:

            <h1>How to Use RestWorld</h1>
        </div>

        <p>
            You spawn in the middle, where you can get a control book that allows you to stop and
            start the looping, as well as speeding it up or slowing it down. You can do these with
            buttons in the middle, but the book is a control you can carry with you. The book also
            has links to the other places in RestWorld (see below).

        <p> Rooms branch off in four directions. When you enter a room, its stuff starts looping
            (unless you've stopped the clock).

        <p> You'll find controls scattered around.
        <ul>
            <li>A button on red or green concrete stops or starts the clock, and the color switches
                too.
            <li>A switch on colored concrete toggles some value in a neighboring loop. For example,
                with the horses, there is a switch that toggles whether or not there is a saddle on
                the horses.
            <li>Buttons on other colored concrete change modes in a neighboring loop. For instance,
                with villagers one button changes to/from zombie villagers, another changes whether
                the loop through biomes (with all professions for a single biome), vs. looping
                through professions (with villagers with the same profession from each biome).
            <li>Other buttons are labelled. And if not, just try it out!
            <li>In the effects room, touch the signs to switch which particles are being shown.
            <li>In the control book, you can open the book and then click on things that are green.
        </ul>

        <p>
            In addition to the main area, there are three other destinations in RestWorld:

        <ul>
            <li>A place to take a representative snapshot of your texture pack.
            <li>A biome sampler, which lets you see your pack in samples of many biomes.
            <li>An arena where you can try out live mobs. You can summon them with commands, such as
                "<code>/summon ~ ~ ~ cow</code>".
        </ul>

        These can be reached using the book you get in the central area.

            RestWorld was built on a lot of commands and functions. In case you're interested, here
            are some details.

        <ul>
            <li> Version numbering will be the same as the Minecraft version they are built for
                (e.g., version 1.15.2 is ready for Minecraft 1.15.2).
            <li> Each room only loops while you're in it (or not too far above it), to keep overhead
                down.
            <li> RestWorld is built on a lot of functions driven from command blocks, using armor
                stands to give a location that is used to base the actions. This means that it is
                somewhat easy to relocate a loop by moving where its armor stand is.
            <li> There is a big reset button outside the main area, but your best bet is to keep a
                copy of the downloaded world around.
        </ul>
