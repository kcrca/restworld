            As Minecraft has evolved, the number of blocks has become larger and larger. There used to be
            a few downloadable test worlds for looking at a pack, but over time these are much more unweildly.
            It leaves a test world with a choice between completeness, compactness, and being able to see
            things with enough room.

        <p>
            RestWorld squares this circle by looping. Blocks and mobs that are similar take up a small space,
            and withing that space, the variations are looped. For example, all the ores take up one block,
            which changes from coal ore to iron ore to gold ore and so on. Each is shown for a couple seconds
            (you can adjust the timing). And you can stop the looping at any time to focus on a specific ore
            texture.

            This means
            you have all blocks and mobs within a space that you can traverse.
            You can also compare how related blocks look. For example, if you want ores to look the same, you
            will notice errors much more easily when you can see the offending ore switched to from another one.

        <p>
            A few examples may help:

            <figure class="example">
                <figcaption>Example: Villagers can be seen in many biomes and professions. Here you see all the
                    professions
                    of villagers in a given biome, which loops.

                <figcaption>Example: The various stages of plants are shown in sequence. In the background you can see
                    some other plant stages looping.

            <h1>How to Use RestWorld</h1>
        </div>

        <p>
            You start in the middle, where you can get a control book that allows you to stop and start the
            looping, as well as speeding it up or slowing it down. You can do these with buttons in the middle,
            but the book is a control you can carry with you.

        <p> Rooms branch off in four directions. When you enter a room, its stuff starts looping (unless you've stopped
            the clock).

        <p> You'll find controls scattered around.
        <ul>
            <li>A button on red or green concrete stops or starts the clock, and the color switches too.
            <li>A switch on colored concrete toggles some value in a neighboring loop. For example, with
                the horses, there is a switch that toggles whether or not there is a saddle on the horses.
            <li>Buttons on other colored concrete change modes in a neighboring loop. For instance, with villagers one button changes to/from
                zombie villagers, another changes whether the loop through biomes (with all professions
                for a single biome), vs. looping through professions (with villagers with the same profession from each
                biome).
            <li>Other buttons are labelled. And if not, just try it out!
            <li>In the effects room, touch the signs to switch which particles are being shown.
	    <li>In the control book, you can open the book and then click on things that are green.
        </ul>

            <h1>Places in RestWorld</h1>
        </div>

	<p>
	In addtion to the main area, there are two other destinations in RestWorld:

	<ul>
	    <li>A place to take a representative snapshot of your texture pack.
	    <li>An arena where you can try out live mobs. You can summon them with 
		commands, such as "<code>/summon ~ ~ ~ cow</code>".
	</ul>

	These can be reached using the book you get in the central area.

            Restworld was built on a lot of commands and functions. In case you're interested, here are some details.

        <ul>
            <li> Version numbering will be the same as the Minecraft version they are built for (e.g., version 1.15.2 is
                ready
                for Minecraft 1.15.2).
            <li> Each room only loops while you're in it (or not too far above it), to keep overhead down.
            <li> RestWorld is built on a lot of functions driven from command blocks, using armor stands to give
                a location that is used to base the actions. This means that it is somewhat easy to relocate
                a loop by moving where its armor stand is.
            <li> There is a big reset button outside the main area, but your best bet is to keep a copy
                of the downloaded world around.
        </ul>
