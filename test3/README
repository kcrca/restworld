Subdirectories represent rooms.

A header comment or defined function call in each file can say which
clock to run on (default "main")

A file is run on a clock unless it has one of the following suffixes:

_init: Run on full reset
_enter: Run on room entry
_exit: Run on room exit
_static: Run by its own means
_funish: Run on its own means, triggered by the main script

For each room, the following functions are created.
    * "tick" function that is run on the every tick when someone is in the room. It checks
      whether a clock has ticked, and if so, calls main_tick, etc. (One clock check triggers
      all related actions.)
    * main_tick, etc. functions that call all the funcitons to be run on the main tick, etc.
    * a "room" function to detect entry/exit from the room, which calls "enter" and "exit" when needed
    * enter and exit functions to be called on room entry and exit, calling all the _enter and _exit funcs
    * entry and exit power the "tick" function
    * for each template, the appropriate specific functions

Shared scores for each multiple?

An armor stand is manually created where each function should run
from. Each function is called positioned at the stand.

A copy of all armor stands is stored somewhere for a full restore.
Or something, cannot clone entities, hm. Need some way to deal with
user accidentally breaking an armor stand, but don't want to list
coordinates of each place to run.

    Have command that has each armor stand say its location and
    name, and a way to build a generating script from the logs?
