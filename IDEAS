Ghast about to fire?

Mob states (have a looping button, a "put all mobs permanently in this state" switch? A "do it once" button"?)
    Sleeping{X,Y,Z} [seems to have no effect]
    Brain:admiring_item for piglins
	Can't seeem to get it to work:
	    {memories: {"minecraft:admiring_items": {value: True, ttl:100}, "minecraft:job_site": {value: {pos: [I; -681, 63, -239], dimension: "minecraft:overworld"}}}}


PHoto needs rework, hacked in a few things from 1.18, but...

Fishing, watching the hook bob and the line ... be a line

Arrows leave traces when shot from bows. Probably already part of particles, but it looks quite different

Flashing TNT about to explode -- tried that, when it's wrong, it's a pain to fix, but maybe?

Sounds. That could be an entire area, but there are _so_ many of them

----- Probably not

All the standard structures? Seems like a lot of work, and the only
advantage is that you could see how your textures look in (say) a
particular manision room. But that seems not very important to how
they look in the world at large. So proably not?

LeftHanded? It seems like a lot of work to make sure all newly spawned items are left-handed, though maybe that
could be done on a clock or _finish?

----- No, kept for the memory
    Show the two kinds of invisible blocks shown during "save" for
    structure blocks
    -- No, these aren't texturable.

"also, i had an idea in the display model viewer to add an invisible armor stand on top of the existing one that had a player head so you can tell if a head model is going to show over/under the head and make sure there is no z-fighting."  https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/ryancr/

    Â¿Expand connected texture area to have a region where you can choose a monster and get multiple of it at the same time? Alphabetical menus like for biomes to pick? How to handle variants, like seeing them with different weapons? Do I care about that?

Status bar stuff
	horse armor level
	poison
	all that stuff in icon.png

The other stuff in icon.png (what's used from there?)

pressure plate may not work both forward and back?
