Ghast about to fire?

Mob states (have a looping button, a "put all mobs permanently in this state" switch? A "do it once" button"?)
    Sleeping{X,Y,Z} [seems to have no effect]
    Brain:admiring_item for piglins
	Can't seeem to get it to work:
	    {memories: {"minecraft:admiring_items": {value: True, ttl:100}, "minecraft:job_site": {value: {pos: [I; -681, 63, -239], dimension: "minecraft:overworld"}}}}


PHoto needs rework, hacked in a few things from 1.18, but...

Fishing, watching the hook bob and the line ... be a line

Arrows leave traces when shot from bows. Probably already part of particles, but it looks quite different

Flashing TNT about to explode -- tried that, when it's wrong, it's a pain to fix, but maybe?

Sounds. That could be an entire area, but there are _so_ many of them

----- Probably not

All the standard structures? Seems like a lot of work, and the only
advantage is that you could see how your textures look in (say) a
particular manision room. But that seems not very important to how
they look in the world at large. So proably not?

LeftHanded? It seems like a lot of work to make sure all newly spawned items are left-handed, though maybe that
could be done on a clock or _finish?

----- No, kept for the memory
    Show the two kinds of invisible blocks shown during "save" for
    structure blocks
    -- No, these aren't texturable.

"also, i had an idea in the display model viewer to add an invisible armor stand on top of the existing one that had a player head so you can tell if a head model is going to show over/under the head and make sure there is no z-fighting."  https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/ryancr/

    Â¿Expand connected texture area to have a region where you can choose a monster and get multiple of it at the same time? Alphabetical menus like for biomes to pick? How to handle variants, like seeing them with different weapons? Do I care about that?

Status bar stuff
	horse armor level
	poison
	all that stuff in icon.png

The other stuff in icon.png (what's used from there?)

pressure plate may not work both forward and back?

HUD should be in GUI area.
    Only really shown in surival mode, so we need an area where that happens. But some
    effects are dangerous, so we have to monitor player health. Maybe not let it get below
    50%? I dunno...

    Can't set play info using standard commands (e.g., "data merge..."). Can only use effects and
    sepcialized commands. Here are the things in the HUD with how to work with them:

    Armor: Put various armor on the player.
	Maybe store what the player is wearing in a chest when they enter, and put it back when they leave?
    Health: Can change using effects instant_health and instant_damage
	Basic: Hearts and half hearts. Just set the player health (which seemingly _can_ be set directly?)
	Poisoned: Poison effect
	Absorption: Absorption effect
	Flashing when drained: For poison, handled naturally. Maybe damage effects will flash for normal.
	    Maybe any damage while withered also flashes, even if not from wither?
    Food level: Hunger effect can decrease, saturation effect increases it (and saturation, of course)
    Saturation: Saturation effect increases, can't see how to decrease it.
	Shown by jiggling the hunger bar periodically when depleted. That's it.
    Experience: /xp command allows manipulation
    Mob (horse) health and armor: Put the player on a horse, then adjust the horse's data, put armor on it, etc.
    Weapon charging: Put a dummy entity they can hit?
    Underwater: Probably need to be put underwater for a while. Don't think we can adjust this manually,
	so I'll have to remove the water and let them recover. Slow clock, probably
