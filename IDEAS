Show the two kinds of invisible blocks shown during "save" for
structure blocks

Show "barrier" in an item frame. Possibly also the two kinds of
invisible blocks.

Environment: Phases of the moon, maybe daytime cycle (pan the user
to be always looking at the sun/moon while it's sped up?)

Named items in item frames display their names when the cursor is
on them. Also, item frames can be invisible. So we can name a very
small thing (button?), put it in an invisible item frame on the
floor over a button or switch to label what it does.  This would
avoid the "signs everywhere" or "say nothing" choice.

Items in frames, like everyone else? The creative menu is missing
a few things (command blocks, structure blocks, structure void,
barrier). Maybe just them?

	Barrier is already a bit hard because we can't show the
	block easily, although anyone who knows about it can just
	give themselves one, hold it, and see them all over the
	block room.
