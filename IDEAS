Ghast about to fire?

Ghast fireball? Is it a separate texture?

Mob states (have a looping button, a "put all mobs permanently in this state" switch? A "do it once" button"?)

Is there a way to show arrows (esp. non-standard ones) in the air, travelling slowly?

----- Probably not

All the standard structures? Seems like a lot of work, and the only
advantage is that you could see how your textures look in (say) a
particular manision room. But that seems not very important to how
they look in the world at large. So proably not?

LeftHanded? It seems like a lot of work to make sure all newly spawned items are left-handed, though maybe that
could be done on a clock or _finish?

----- No, kept for the memory
    Show the two kinds of invisible blocks shown during "save" for
    structure blocks
    -- No, these aren't texturable.
