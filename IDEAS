Ghast about to fire?

Mob states (have a looping button, a "put all mobs permanently in this state" switch? A "do it once" button"?)
    Sleeping{X,Y,Z} [seems to have no effect]
    Brain:admiring_item for piglins
	Can't seeem to get it to work:
	    {memories: {"minecraft:admiring_items": {value: True, ttl:100}, "minecraft:job_site": {value: {pos: [I; -681, 63, -239], dimension: "minecraft:overworld"}}}}

----- Probably not

All the standard structures? Seems like a lot of work, and the only
advantage is that you could see how your textures look in (say) a
particular manision room. But that seems not very important to how
they look in the world at large. So proably not?

LeftHanded? It seems like a lot of work to make sure all newly spawned items are left-handed, though maybe that
could be done on a clock or _finish?

----- No, kept for the memory
    Show the two kinds of invisible blocks shown during "save" for
    structure blocks
    -- No, these aren't texturable.
