Show the two kinds of invisible blocks shown during "save" for
structure blocks

Show "barrier" in an item frame. Possibly also the two kinds of
invisible blocks.

Environment: Phases of the moon, maybe daytime cycle (pan the user
to be always looking at the sun/moon while it's sped up?)
    Moon:
	    3rd quarter		time set 70000
	    waning crescent	time set 94000
	    new			time set 118000
	    waxing crescent	time set 142000
	    1st quarter		time set 166000
	    waxing gibbous	time set 190000
	    full		time set 214000
	    waning gibbous	time set 46000

Named items in item frames display their names when the cursor is
on them. Also, item frames can be invisible. So we can name a very
small thing (button?), put it in an invisible item frame on the
floor over a button or switch to label what it does.  This would
avoid the "signs everywhere" or "say nothing" choice.

Items in frames, like everyone else? The creative menu is missing
a few things (command blocks, structure blocks, structure void,
barrier). Maybe just them?

	Barrier is already a bit hard because we can't show the
	block easily, although anyone who knows about it can just
	give themselves one, hold it, and see them all over the
	block room.

All the standard structures? Seems like a lot of work, and the only
advantage is that you could see how your textures look in (say) a
particular manision room. But that seems not very important to how
they look in the world at large. So proably not?
