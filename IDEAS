[x] No, these aren't texturable.
    Show the two kinds of invisible blocks shown during "save" for
    structure blocks

Named items in item frames display their names when the cursor is
on them. Also, item frames can be invisible. So we can name a very
small thing (button?), put it in an invisible item frame on the
floor over a button or switch to label what it does.  This would
avoid the "signs everywhere" or "say nothing" choice.

Items in frames, like everyone else? The creative menu is missing
a few things (command blocks, structure blocks, structure void,
barrier). Maybe just them?

	Barrier is already a bit hard because we can't show the
	block easily, although anyone who knows about it can just
	give themselves one, hold it, and see them all over the
	block room.

All the standard structures? Seems like a lot of work, and the only
advantage is that you could see how your textures look in (say) a
particular manision room. But that seems not very important to how
they look in the world at large. So proably not?
