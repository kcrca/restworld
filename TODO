llama carpet returns but vanishes when "plain" is turned off.

coloring area: wolf armor (have wolf standing, I'm guessing)
coloring area: Put item displays up for colored armors? I think not, but think about it. They are not in the creative menu

maybe keep all the areas loaded so room specific tp works
