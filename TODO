maybe keep all the areas loaded so room specific tp works

Old-fashioned heraldry terms on banners too?

Make labels be text_display's, probably on the ground facing up, with a direction (so it faces the path). Or maybe we can make
the text_display have a few blank lines above the label, and let it rotate to face the player around the y axis _only_, which
might keep the text towards the outer edge of the block.


Dragon Fireball is wonky

Something weird happened to ambient entity effect, like it disappeared? Wait until the next release to see if that's a bug

Vault top seems wrong [clarity problem]

connected textures not working

Errors in funciton loading (not ambient stuff, mostly all_items, etc.)
