Trial spawner should have active spawner block, right?

Ominous Trial Spawner's name overruns the line on the sign, but if it's put on the to line, the "expand" stuff removes

Ideas on new block loops:
    pull deepslate ores into its own loop
    tiles could be different loops
    put end rod back into its own block
    put honeycomb back into its own block
    split shrieker variants to its own loop
    heavy core
