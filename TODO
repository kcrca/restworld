maybe keep all the areas loaded so room specific tp works

Old-fashioned heraldry terms on banners too?

Dragon Fireball is wonky

particles:
    Many new particles, maybe create a book that lists where some
    particles can be seen elsewhere to free up those slots (e.g.,
    redstone dust particles) Find which particles re-use the same
    textures and remove or combine into one sign? Have more particles
    loop, e.g., the new ominious trial spanwer with the regular
    trial spanwer? Or make the room bigger (longer, probably)?

fonts:
    italics and bold? Maybe using text display entities? Or switches
    that turn all text bold / italic, etc.? Hm...

include mace somehow in the basic materials loop? So one can see the
enchantment texture on it, e.g.?

Check for effects that can be shown as in the real world instead of manual
"particle" command

Trial spawner should have active spawner block, right?

Clean up particles for no-longer-used functions

Enderman needs protection from rain/snow (I think; I saw it in the wrong place once.)

vault should be on its own loop, right next to the spanwer loop

Ideas on new block loops:
    pull deepslate ores into its own loop
    tiles could be different loops
    put end rod back into its own block
    put honeycomb back into its own block
    split shrieker variants to its own loop
