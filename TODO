maybe keep all the areas loaded so room specific tp works

Old-fashioned heraldry terms on banners too?

Make labels be text_display's, probably on the ground facing up, with a direction (so it faces the path). Or maybe we can make
the text_display have a few blank lines above the label, and let it rotate to face the player around the y axis _only_, which
might keep the text towards the outer edge of the block.
