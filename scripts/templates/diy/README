This is designed to be expandle and entirely using relative coordinates.

It works by using structure blocks to save and restore parts. This allows transfer between places
without knowing the specific distances involved.

The only problem with this is that Save structure blocks always show their outline, which would be
ugly. So we can leave Load structure blocks around, but not Save ones. So we create them when we
need them, fire them, and then replace them. Stone blocks are used as placeholders.
