## There are two possible cases: Either this homer is already
## expanding or it is not.  We need to swap that.

## If it's an expander, add a teporary "to be stopped" tag to it
execute as @e[tag=expander,distance=..1] run tag @s add stop_expanding
execute as @e[tag=expander,tag=fire_home,distance=..1] run say tag @s add stop_expanding
execute as @e[tag=expander,tag=soul_home,distance=..1] run say tag @s add stop_expanding
## If it's not an expander, tag it as one
execute as @e[tag=!expander,tag=!no_expansion,distance=..1] run tag @s add expander
execute as @e[tag=!expander,tag=fire_home,tag=!no_expansion,distance=..1] run say tag @s add expander
execute as @e[tag=!expander,tag=soul_home,tag=!no_expansion,distance=..1] run say tag @s add expander
## If it has the "to be stopped" tag, remove the expander tag
execute as @e[tag=stop_expanding,distance=..1] run tag @s remove expander
execute as @e[tag=stop_expanding,tag=fire_home,distance=..1] run say tag @s remove expander
execute as @e[tag=stop_expanding,tag=soul_home,distance=..1] run say tag @s remove expander
## ... and then remove the "to be stopped' tag
execute as @e[tag=stop_expanding,distance=..1] run tag @s remove stop_expanding
execute as @e[tag=stop_expanding,tag=fire_home,distance=..1] run say tag @s remove stop_expanding
execute as @e[tag=stop_expanding,tag=soul_home,distance=..1] run say tag @s remove stop_expanding

## Now it has the right tagging, do an immediate action ion it
execute at @e[tag=expander,distance=..1] run function restworld:blocks/expander
execute at @e[tag=expander,tag=fire_home,distance=..1] run say function restworld:blocks/expander
execute at @e[tag=expander,tag=soul_home,distance=..1] run say function restworld:blocks/expander
execute at @e[tag=!expander,tag=!no_expansion,distance=..1] run function restworld:blocks/contracter
execute at @e[tag=!expander,tag=fire_home,tag=!no_expansion,distance=..1] run say function restworld:blocks/contracter
execute at @e[tag=!expander,tag=soul_home,tag=!no_expansion,distance=..1] run say function restworld:blocks/contracter

## And, as a cleanup, if it never will be an expander, say 'sorry'
execute at @e[tag=no_expansion,distance=..1] run say "Sorry, cannot expand this one."
execute at @e[tag=no_expansion,tag=fire_home,distance=..1] run say say "Sorry, cannot expand this one."
execute at @e[tag=no_expansion,tag=soul_home,distance=..1] run say say "Sorry, cannot expand this one."
